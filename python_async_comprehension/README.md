# 🚀 Python - Asynchronous Execution 🌟  

## Introduction 🧠  

Asynchronous execution in Python allows you to write **concurrent** code without the need for threads or multiple processes. It's particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks, such as web requests or database queries. Using coroutines and the `async/await` syntax, your code can perform multiple tasks simultaneously in an efficient manner. ⚡

## Basic Concepts 📚

### 1️⃣ Coroutine
A coroutine is a special type of function that can **pause** its execution to allow other tasks to run. It can later resume where it left off. 🛑➡️▶️

Defined with `async`:  

    async def my_coroutine():
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print("Coroutine executed!")
