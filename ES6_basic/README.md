# ES6 Basics Project

This project explores the fundamental features introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), which modernized JavaScript and improved its functionality, readability, and efficiency. ES6 introduces new syntax, constants, block-scoped variables, template literals, arrow functions, and much more. Through this project, youâ€™ll become familiar with these new concepts and how to implement them.
