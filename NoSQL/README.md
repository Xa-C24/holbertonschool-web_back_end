## Overview
This document serves as an introduction to NoSQL databases, their types, advantages, and use cases. It also provides guidance on getting started with NoSQL and includes an example of usage.

---

## What is NoSQL?
NoSQL databases are non-relational database systems that store and retrieve data in a variety of formats other than traditional tabular relations used by relational databases (RDBMS). NoSQL is designed for flexibility, scalability, and performance in handling unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data.

---

## Types of NoSQL Databases
1. **Document Stores**: Store data in JSON, BSON, or XML formats (e.g., MongoDB, Couchbase).
2. **Key-Value Stores**: Use a simple key-value pair model (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB).
3. **Column Stores**: Store data in column families instead of rows (e.g., Apache Cassandra, HBase).
4. **Graph Databases**: Focus on relationships between entities (e.g., Neo4j, ArangoDB).

---

## Advantages of NoSQL
- **Scalability**: Easily scale horizontally by adding more servers.
- **Flexibility**: Handle diverse data formats without strict schemas.
- **High Performance**: Optimize for high-speed read and write operations.
- **Distributed Architecture**: Operate efficiently across distributed systems.

---

## Use Cases
- Real-time analytics and monitoring.
- Content management systems.
- IoT applications with high ingestion rates.
- Social networking and graph-based queries.
- E-commerce and recommendation engines.

---

## Getting Started
1. **Install a NoSQL Database**: Choose and install a NoSQL database based on your requirements (e.g., MongoDB, Redis).
2. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   - Ensure the necessary drivers are installed for your programming language.
   - Configure the database connection.
3. **Start Using the Database**:
   - Define your data model.
   - Perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Example Usage

### MongoDB Example: Inserting and Querying Documents
```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

# Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["example_database"]
collection = db["example_collection"]

# Insert a document
document = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
collection.insert_one(document)

# Query documents
for doc in collection.find({"age": {"$gt": 20}}):
    print(doc)
